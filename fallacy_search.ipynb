However, the drumming on the first four albums, especially AFJA, was pretty solid. The fact is, Lars is responsible for some of the most memorable drum parts in metal (like the machine gun double bass part in One) and he is absolutely indispensable to the songwriting process with James. Lars, Kirk and even Cliff have all been criticized for their technical skills, but their creativity, along with James (who is an excellent songwriter and rhythm guitarist), was what made Metallica the greatest metal band of all time, not their chops.\n"
