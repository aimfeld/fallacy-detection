Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities. Porn is also highly addictive, and has diminishing returns over time, so a user will have to watch more porn, or more extreme porn, to get the same amount of dopamine.
