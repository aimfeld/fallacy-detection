This repository contains the code and data for the data science master's thesis "Detecting Logical Fallacies with LLMs". The thesis was written and submitted in December 2024 by Adrian Imfeld at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) in Switzerland. For more information, please refer to the thesis document linked above.

The [Fallacy Search](https://fallacy-search.streamlit.app/) web application was developed as a part of the thesis and allows users to identify and analyze logical fallacies in text. The code for the application can be found in the accompanying [fallacy-search](https://github.com/aimfeld/fallacy-search) repository.
