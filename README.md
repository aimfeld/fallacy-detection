This repository contains the code and data for the data science master's thesis "Detecting Logical Fallacies with LLMs". The thesis was written and submitted in December 2024 by Adrian Imfeld at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) in Switzerland. For more information, please refer to the thesis document linked above.

These are the main notebooks in this repository:

- [fallacy_experiments.ipynb](fallacy_experiments.ipynb): Code for the fallacy identification, classification, and search experiments.
- [fallacy_identification.ipynb](fallacy_identification.ipynb): Data analysis for the binary fallacy identification experiments.
- [fallacy_classification.ipynb](fallacy_classification.ipynb): Data analysis for the fallacy classification experiments.
- [fallacy_search.ipynb](fallacy_search.ipynb): Data analysis for the fallacy search experiment. 
- [fine_tuning.ipynb](fine_tuning.ipynb): Code for fine-tuning GPT-4o Mini on the fallacy identification and classification tasks.

The [Fallacy Search](https://fallacy-search.streamlit.app/) web application was developed as a part of the thesis and allows users to identify and analyze logical fallacies in text. The tool aims to promote critical thinking and improve the quality of public discourse by making logical analysis more accessible. The code for the application can be found in the accompanying [fallacy-search](https://github.com/aimfeld/fallacy-search) repository.
